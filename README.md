# Backhand

A minimalist fork of [The Offhand Mod](https://github.com/TCLProject/theoffhandmod), which itself is forked from [Mine&Blade Battlegear 2](https://github.com/Mine-and-blade-admin/Battlegear2), that backports a sole offhand slot with functionality close to vanilla Minecraft's later versions' offhand. No extra items are added from Battlegear2, but extra functionality has been added for the offhand such as a blacklist and allowing attacking with the offhand. These functions are disabled by default and can be toggled through the config file.

Big thanks to TCLProject, the creator of the offhand mod. Another huge thanks to nerd-boy & GotoLink as well, the authors of Mine&Blade Battlegear 2.
